21. Calculate net salary (Net salary = Gross salary + allowance – deduction, allowance = 10% and deduction = 3% of gross salary)

23. Calculate average of three subjects along with their total
24. Swap two values

2.3 =  Find out net salary where net salary = gross salary + allowances – deductions.
	 If gross salary > 10000, allowances are 10%, deductions are 3% 
	 If gross salary > 5000, allowances are 7%, deduction are 2%

2.4 =  Find out whether a given no. is divisible by 7 or not.

2.5 =  Find out net sales where net sales = gross sales – discount.
	 If gross sales > 20000, discount is 15%
 	 If gross sales > 10000, discount is 10% otherwise 5%.

2.6 =  Calculate total, average of marks of three subjects. Give following grades to the student.
 		If average   >= 70, distinction,
              		     >= 60, first,
